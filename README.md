Parallel Programming Demo In CUDA

# Introduction
This repositiory contains some demo of parallel programming using NVIDIA CUDA C/C++.

CUDA was developed by NVIDIA to provide simple access to GPGPU (General-Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units) and parallel computing on their own GPU’s. The logic behind the idea is that GPU’s have much more processing power than CPU’s and have numerous cores that operate in parallel to run intensive graphics operations. By allowing developers to utilize this power for their own projects, it can create fast solutions to some heavy and time-consuming programs, specifically those that run the same process recursively and independently of other processes. ![src](https://hub.packtpub.com/introduction-parallel-programming-and-cuda-sample-code/)
